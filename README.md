# AUTOMATIC STREET LIGHT SYSTEM
TOOLS USED:ARDUINO UNO,LDR SENSOR,LED,BREADBOARD,RESISTORS,JUMPER WIRES.


In this project LDR sensor is used which switches on Led automatically when it is dark and switch off when there is light .It is a resistor with resistance that changes according to the amount of light falling on it.
Their resistance decreases as the light intensity increases,and in the dark the resistance of an LDR is high.
